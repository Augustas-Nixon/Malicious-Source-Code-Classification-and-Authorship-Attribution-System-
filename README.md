# Malicious-Source-Code-Classification-and-Authorship-Attribution-System-
Developed a two-stage Source Code Forensics system to classify code as malicious or benign using TF-IDF + Random Forest, and detect authorship (Human vs AI-generated) using TF-IDF/Ada embeddings with XGBoost, SVM, and RF. Evaluated across multiple LLMs and code quality categories.

The code can be run directly on Google Colab.

The code uses open-ai api, which is paid and has to be changed with a personal api-key that can be obttained after registering in the opani website.

The final result will have a input dialogue box which can be used to input the source code to be checked.
