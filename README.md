# Malicious-Source-Code-Classification-and-Authorship-Attribution-System-
Developed a two-stage Source Code Forensics system to classify code as malicious or benign using TF-IDF + Random Forest, and detect authorship (Human vs AI-generated) using TF-IDF/Ada embeddings with XGBoost, SVM, and RF. Evaluated across multiple LLMs and code quality categories.
